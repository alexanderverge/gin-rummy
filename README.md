# GinRummy

We created an open source gin rummy card game in Java.

See [here](http://rummy.com/ginrummy.html) for the rules of this game.

## Contribute an AI

This game is incomplete! While the framework for the game is finished, the game could really use some stellar AIs. If you are interested in AI, this would be a great project to contribute to! To get started, take a look at the classes `AIEngine`, `AIBrain`, `BasicAI`, and `SmartAI`.
